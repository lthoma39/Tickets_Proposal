# Tickets_Proposal
This was a proposal demo that I made at Safespeed. 
My job at Safespeed is to give tickets.
I created this idea where we can use a verify button to double check a license plate through a website to make sure our accuracy for giving tickets is improved.
Basically after entering a license plate, if you hit the verify button AutoCheck.com will open.
Then Selenium will automatically enter the information you provided into AutoCheck then verify if it's correct.

I deliberately made a basic looking GUI to resemble what I do at my job to help better visualize my proposal. 
For potential legal issues, I won't design a more detailed GUI.
